### Problem Description

The problem we are trying to solve is how difficult it is to get parts for a new PC for the best price. There are many different retailers offering the same components at different prices, which makes it challenging to identify the lowest price across all websites. The prices of computer parts change frequently, making it very hard for any one person to keep track of multiple websites manually. In order to solve this problem, we plan to create a web scrapper that will get the prices of various computer parts:

- CPU
- GPU
- RAM
- Motherboard
- CPU Cooler
- Case
- Power supply

We plan to make the representation of this data easily understandable through both numerical and graphical means so that the user can completely understand how the price of any one product has changed over time and if it is the right time to buy that product.
